# 50startups-profit-prediction
In this project I collected dataset regarding 50 startups from kaggle. This dataset has the R and D spend,marketing spend, Administration spend,profit of those startups. I self implemented multiple linear Regression from scratch and predicted profits of those companies using this model. I compared the results of this model by uisng scikit learn inbuilt regression function. I got scores of both my model implemented by me and scikit learn model got same r2 score
